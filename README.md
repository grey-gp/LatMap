# LatMap
App that shows you a list of other cities across the globe that share a latitude within a specified range of a searched city.

LatMap started as a simple idea because I wanted to quickly see cities that had a similar latitude to the one I lived in. 

I would love to add more functionality such as general climate traits to get an understanding what cities in different countries may have similar climates to ones I know.
